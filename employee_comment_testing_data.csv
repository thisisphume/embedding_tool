privacy concern
It is very general.  I am sure different departments have different issues.  I should be monitored more closely.
Specified questions following a choice made for a previous question is apprecaited.
"it's a typical survey, nothing special comparing to what we have completed in the past."
Ability to give written answers and shorter survey
Able to write what I want to address in the survey.
Multiple choice questions are easier to answer.
I am not certain that having a good feeling is an accurate description for doing this survey
"It allows for an explanation, along the way"
The required 10 min to fill in the survey are a bit misleading given the nature of the open ended questions
How confidential are our answers????
Like questions and my own free form answers at my discretion
"Required by manager, hoping my voice really counts"
"Some questions allow for broad interpretation. Employees may answer a certain way, but it will not be clear whether the feedback is directed toward immediate team, division or business platform."
I think that more questions provides further insight for the bank to see what is on the minds of employees throughout the organization in a more standardized manner.  I think this format is more difficult to extrapolate the data.
je trouve les questions vagues et ceci ne permet pas aux employés de donner leur opinion sur plusieurs sujets
the question let me share how i real feel
"length of survey, would also like to mention that our manager genuinely cares for us and our client and is very knowledgable and hardworking just needs to trust us a bit more."
Ability to put down my thoughts versus simply multiple choice questions.
"Survey questions were flexible, helping to keep things more relevant and simple."
The question not really focus concern on employee
Needed the survey section for management
"Sondage Clair, mais beaucoup de questions ouvertes qui risquent d'entraîner autant de réponses que de situations personnelles"
Asking the right questions
Given opportunity to speak up.
Questions where I am required to type in responses are far too broad.
I'm not certain that we can speak up safely
the point touch our voice
Ability to express my opinion without fear of reprimandation.
Too many questions that require written responses.
the free text fields made me think specifically about my answers and be specific about the feedback.
"En effet les questions pas tres clair, surtout la première.... qui fait en sorte que tous les autres questions sont posés.   Trop vagues et large comme compréhensions de la question."
It doesnt seem like an audit but demonstrates you want to hear us so we can better our organization or order to continue to be the #1 bank in Canada !
This survey is not confidential enough for written answers.
"It should reflect our current COVID-19 situation better. And also ask us for feedback, and suggestions, as well as maybe adding a poll to get a deeper understanding of RBC's emplyees thoughts. To really make it a One RBC"
j'ai pu donner mon opinion
Questions are clear but requires to much input. I prefer to select.
"Opportunity share my view on some areas, instaed of all questions being restricted to merely choice between pre-listed answers"
"There should be more agree/disagree type of Qs than plain text, to get clarity on outcome"
wanted to think about the answers so that they are meaningful
Not a fan of having to write reasons to support answers.  A survey should have specific responses expected and have the person select.  Always include a N/A option.
Too many written responses required to further clarify only one section
Survey should offer opportunity to cover all choices from the first screen. Instead we can only pick one subject.
"No further changes in terms of management, I dont feel inspired when none of my best skilled colleague get promoted internally"
"Asked by seniors to do ,Surveys actually dont help much , have this feeling. not sure if the vocie is heard or not ."
"i want to get my word accross, hopefully someone hears it"
"it made me think, and reafirm, what my and RBC's priorities should be"
sondage parfait
I was able to share my thoughts through this.
I do want to share my opion and want RBC to hear their employee voice.
Was weird to choose what to answer
It is an opportunity to share my opinions concerning my career at RBC.
Gives us an oppurtunity to express ourselves.
It was a bit too focused. But it was short and I got to tell what i needed to say
simply that having a good experience seems an odd way to describe completing a survey - do you mean insofar as completing a survey goes?
"Le sondage est bien fait, court et simple. A toutes les semaines je réponds à ce genre de questions avec mon gestionnaire. Elle se préocuppe beaucoup du bien être de nous tous. Elle s'est que nous sommes épuisés avec tout ce qui arrive avec la 2e vague de la pandémie etc, mais elle s'informe TOUJOURS de comment on va mentalememt, physiquement. Je suis très à l'aise de communiquer avec elle. En gros je suis fière d'appartenir à la famille RBC."
Express my opinion anonymously
Free form questions - and being precise with feedback.
Not sure what to say
sense of being heard
at least the employeris concerned aout the employees. Thanks
still feel very uncomfortable with answers and privacy
Being able to exspress my opinion in comment and not having yes/no questions!!!
Toute ses reponses
Way too many comment sections asking for clarification.
There were too many long answer questions.
"les cases commentaires ,"
The primary reason for my answer is points 1 - 3.
"Simplicité du sondage, Clarté des questions mais aussi possibilités de personnaliser notre feedback."
Just being asked.
How do the questions contribute to improving RBC?
The experience of filling out the survey did not move me.  I believe employee surveys play an important role in obtaining infomration from staff and help engage staff.  That said for me personally the experience is neither negativenor positive.
i can provide specific answer in my own word on specific questions
I liked how it anticipated where to prompt me for comments and the length was short.
You geared it toward answers you wanted it to be
All of the above
too short.. we're losing an opportunity to get insights about the level of engagement within our teams as well as where we could specifically focus on for enablement within our teams by not asking and getting responses from more questions
nothing seems to come out of the survey - i dont see any changes
A survey question on the survey?  Really?  Is this really a good use of the resource?
Perhaps the free form questions could have have been more specific. I struggled a bit with what to write.
"""A good experience filling out a survey""?  What world does one inhabit where one has a ""good experience"" filling out any survey?"
Survey was directed towards employee satisfaction which is a key factor in an organizations development.
Fewer questions - more comments.
"The last part where we are asked to select a topic ""to tell more about our experience at RBC"" is not clear from the outset.  Also not sure I understand why I was asked to provide more details on my response ""Agree"" to the question ""I am valued at RBC"""
"Basic questions, no reason to strongly agree or disagree"
la possibilité de s'exprimer par texte est un réel plus
"Open field dialogs to explain some thoughts versus just checking a box.  Interpreting the data may be challenging, but allowing a more open dialog about things that impact employees is great!"
the qualitative input brings meaning to the survey
custom answers
All of the above
Unsure about quantity of freeform text fields.
"La question que l'on peut choisir de quoi on veut parler, n'est vraiment pas clair sur le genre de feed-back que vous désirez avoir. C'est très large et difficile de répondre sur mon travail précisément."
toutes ces réponses
All of the above
receive reminder email from my manager
"Impression que ca va rien changer. Si les employés n'étaient pas là, il n'y aurait pas de RBC!"
easier without free form answers.
Questions ouvertes
Too many user input questions
To be able to share my thoughts and my contentment with RBC.
Open ended questions
"j'aurais aimé pouvoir sélectionner plus d'une réponse car le fait que ce sondage soi cour, simple, et question clair mon énormément plus..merci"
I feel in touch and my opinion counts. I wanted RBC to know they are doing a great job informing us general staff of any updates. It hepls put my mind at ease at this time
not too many options
Ability to have my voice heard.
"Systematic Racism, White Supremacy and Nepotism."
trop de question long développement
Too many questions to fill out.  Rather keep it at multiple choice
Too many open questions. Previous format of the survey was better.
Les questions ouvertes permettent de réfléchir!
"All of the above mentioned points, plus the extended opportunities to share individual comments and feedback. Great initiative, many thanks!"
"This is first time ever I had to submit negative feedback, and that is because of the poor systems we have to use while working from home."
"While the convenince of a short survey is appreicated, it wold have been good (given the delay in this year's survey) to comment more on other areas rather than just having to pick one."
They survey only allowed me to comment on one of the topics presented at the start of the survey.  I wasn't given the option to comment on a few of the areas.
Not sure presently how much change that will bring about
"Same questions each year, no true change thereafter implemented."
To help RBC understand what I believe about the the company and my career at the bank.
The survey was easy to complete and allowed for further explanation and individual responses
more free form than I have time for
i dont think the survey results will get the correct picture as you answer a question and then are prompted to reply based on that one question and you dont have the freedom to expand on other issues you may be having as an employee.
Utilité
"experience is neither good or bad, just an opertunity to give comment to what we have experienced, working through this rough time. regardless i thank you for the opertunity to say somthing, and thankyou for listenning."
j'aime pas à avoir faire des commentaires suite à mes réponses aux questions
"Claity of questions + Length of survey + Ease of completing it. This is so much better then the other Employee Opinion Survey as it is more to the point, the questions are clear and the survey is short!"
sondage simple et court.
Keeping an open comment box or asking a question which provided chance to share thoughts.
possibliter de s'exprimez plus et les questions plus courtes
le fait qu'on puisse s'exprimer et laisser des commentaires!
Quick and easy
Clarity of questions and the ability to explain more and add more content
I have never thought of doing a survey to give me either good or bad experience
les point a trater son claire
A bit more emphasis on questions about our actual managers and less about RBC's management as a whole.
all of the above
Complete surveys are small steps towards change.
"Les questions sont tres larges, devrait etre plus precis que ca"
Space to share our feedback
the beginning question can lead to a lot of brownnosing
To voice my opinio over what direction hiring and growth should take.
Survey does not capture Covid related situations and how employees need support with flexible work arrangements
Only lip service... a chosen few are always rewarded
"je n aime pas elabore prefere un choix de reponse, ajouter une question a la fin afin de s exprimer"
Possibilité d'écrire des commentaires
"Plus simple, plus clair et beaucoup moins long. Permet également de développer d'avantage."
my personal feedback
Did not really like the way the survey started.   Would have prefered it to be a  questions asked instead of having to choose which topic to talk about.
all of the above
The areas/topic at the onset looks very generic and broad that scares off.
"Questions were quick, and rather than lengthy opaque and general questions, free text maybe the best way to truly get a feel for how the staff feel. In 9 years at the Bank, I have always written 2000 characters of feedback, however, I have never received any follow up or call about my thoughts, which makes us question why bother with adding your thoughts. Hopefully this changes"
Free text fields take time to complete and results are difficult to summarise for leadership
Questions seemed to ignore the real issues and are digging for answers unrelated to concerns.
The format feels very exposing and I am not comfortable to provide comments
Joy of filling out a survey
I wasn't expecting to write out responses and found it challenging given my responses were going to be shared verbatim
possibilié de mieux s'exprimer vs simplement répondre à des niveaux de satisfaction
Too many required comments
i enjoyed the old style of the EOS better
no Action is taken and if there is it takes many years to come to fuition
Prefer to answer questions in person rather than a survey
There are more nuances to the questions that may not be capture true responses by gradation
Different format than used to....feels 'put on the spot' a bit.  (Still grateful to have an employer willing to ask though)
Prefer the rating questions vs questions that require a lot of comments.
"in previous surveys, there was no section that required written responses or further information. This should be purely optional and may deter staff from completing the survey when they approach these sections."
"Questions were though provoking, and not simply 150 questions that gets monotonous. Furthermore, I appreaciate the length, as we have other more pressing client-related tasks to balance."
I don't find text boxes helpful or easy to complete in meaningful way (I get the irony of me answering this question with a text box answer....but it wasnt one of the options!) :)
An occasion to help to do better in the future
il manque des questions sur les conditions de travails...
too vague
Able to express myself.
"Length of survey, types of questions are more relevant and pertinent and better address areas of concern"
"La longueur, simplicité ET les petites qestions a ''développement''"
"The shorter format is nice, but still feels like a lot of the same questions."
Sondage trop large et clarté des questions difficile a comprendre
J'aurais aimé des question précises du debut - Car j'ai tout simplement parlé de ce qui me tenait a coeur personnellement
"Don't like the essay questions interspersed in the middle of it, at the opening of it."
it gave me a place to speak the truth without being judged or reprimanded
I appreciated that I can write comments and truly express my own thoughts.  I could feedback what I wanted to versus what the survey dictated.  I've wanted this format for years.  Thank you.
Focus on open ended questions is uncomfortable
I felt it was more personalized
In the hope that the responses will resonate and lead to meaningful changes (though my expectations are low).
more of my opinion rather multiple choice....much better way of reflecting.
"The questions of this survey are rather common, nothing special"
able to express my thoughts
"All of the questions asked about how I feel about RBC as an organization and what I appreciate about the changes made. While I appreciate the swiftness of new tools to help make business still possible, there is a strong sense of overwhelm as the pressure to meet work expectations have not been revisited to account for the time and effort to adjust to change."
there are free spaces for writing subjective observations.
It felt too short and left a lot on the table. It lacked queries relating WFH or RTP feedback. It lacked focus on the objectives for each business unit. It lacked candid feedback for people managers. It lacked a link to RBC's strategy. What is management really trying to achieve here?
able to provide feedback  that hopefully will bring some type of change for better work environment
The one thing this survey is missing is ability to provide views on compensation / personal advnacement.
the fact that we were able to write what we wanted in order to be clear was great
to give my honest opinion with rbc. as i am proud to work with rbc
ability to capture variety of responses.
le sens des questions semble trop large pas assez touché ou ciblé sur ce que on ressent pour ce que on fait
"There was a lot more space to write clear and careful responses versus just picking a number, which can lack nuance."
I odn't like surveys.
open ended questions are not always easy to answer; questions not always interpreted as intended
does not seem very in depth to get enough information about how employees feel
chance to speack up what's on mind
Was not anticipating the probing questions that followed certain responses from the scale. This was good but does require a little more time to complete.
Allowed me to share what was important to me rather than each section of the survey showing the options I could choose from.  This was a good combination of free form and choosing the most appropriate answer.
"The website locked the first day I tried to complete the survey.  But today when I clicked on my Start Survey link thinking I would have to start from the beginning, I was able to start where I left off."
It wasn't clear I could only discuss one topic... I wanted to touch on a few categories with the text box comments...
Ability to specify ( include my own thoughs)
I do not like to write things in a survey for security and complete transparancy.
Too many requested written responses
"j'ai repondu tres en accord avec une question mais apres avoir soumis, j'ai recu un message de completer pourquoi je ne suis pas en accord, je pense qu'il y a une erreur technique"
I really am kind of sick of these things.
I have been having this kind of survey for more than 10 years
Opportunity to provide written feedback.
"The narrative portion of the survey was a bit lengthy. I can see that being an annoyance for employees to complete especially given the ""virtual"" world we are experiencing. I have found that asking employees to do another thing, outside of the overwhelming number of responsiblities that are occurring in our current envionment may not result in meaningful responses or any responses. In my expience, quick scheduled informal events receive the most engagement."
"possibilité de mettre plus de notes donc de justifier des réponses , je souhaite qu'il en ai plus pour les prochains"
pouvoir mettre des notes et des commentaires
Short survey. Didn't specifically ask questions that would generate an emotional response.
though i like the opportunity to provide open answer i am unsure why the first question had so many option if i am not able to go back and provided feedback to those area too.  i may have picked a different option if i knew i wasnt responding to all topics
for space for personal opinions
The flow seemed awkward between multiple choice and text responses
all of the above except mobile device. I did it on computer so not applicable
The format allows us to dive in to answers for each questions and details our response more accuretly.
an opportunity to express our feelings
"The ability to speak honestly, to elaborate on my answers"
Sometimes should be an option. And things like when and how often do you want to return to the office should be considered.
Requests for free form responses too open ended
"Even knowing the survey is confidential, I get anxious giving answers which could come back to negatively affect me."
"I got error message when almost done, and that took me back to a question I answered and I had to answer again"
"simple, claire et rapide ...toutes ses reponses !"
It wasn't sufficient enough for me to provide clarity on my experience. It focused more on my job but not so much on my immediate management. The experience on both topics are very different.
"overall easy to answer as it was short and simple. some questions were random but as is with all surveys, what will come from this?"
"Surveys are a waste of my time because no one really pays attention to the answers, IMHO.."
Ease of completing and I also like that other questions or clarifications came up because of previous choices.
In the past the survey provided the ability to provide feedback at various levels of the organisation. As I completed the survey I wasn't sure how the data would roll up and if it would be meaningful.
"I'm glad to give the feedback, but more importantly I'd like to see a response and a change in the current RBC setup."
Not sure what will be done with the answers or if anything will change. Do not feel 100% comfotable about speaking up when comments are asked as I am not sure they are private and confidential so worried about consequences.
reflexion!
I find these surverys are useless.  Rolling up surveys dilutes results and even if results are not diluted nothing gets done with negative results.  Management behaviors are not addressed nor corrected.
Not impressed
"we are working and living in difficult times, so I wanted to questions to be more comprehensive regarding the circumstances"
"I preffer the multiple choise format with optional comments, rather than the open ended questions."
Both Ease of completing the survey & its lenght
I get to voice my concerns in a more subjective way
pour moi toute est correct
I would rate strongly agree if there were only options to choose rather than having to type in answers.  length of survey was great
Suggest changing majority of open text boxes to multiple choice and have 1 open text remaining at the end to help with user drop off in completing the survey.
Opportunity to express thoughts and feelings and explanation.
"Questions are too focused and do not cover off other areas of importance such as decision making authority, accountability and leadership."
Je trouve que RBC fait trop de sondage
It immediately and without warning narrowed in on the first area that I chose and so I was not provided with an opportunity to voice my opinions on the breadth of topics that I feel are important.
Un peu saisi et déstabilisé par les questions.  Je n'étais pas préparé à ça.  Questions vagues. J'ai l'impression que je ne vous ai rien appris.
Les sondages en cette période de COVID devrait être plus axés sur le bien-être et es besoins en succursale suite à cette année bien particulière qui demande beaucoup d'énergie. Si on veut réduire l'épuisement professionnel
"everything is just from RBC point of view, not so much about what employee may want"
Probing questions about certain answers. Random selection of follow on questions.
HR Dept. to read all my concern. Thank you
"No real results will happen due to this survey, just like all the other surveys."
Ability to express concerns
"The question where it asks you to pick a topic, what if there were more than one topic someone wanted to speak or comment on? Otherwise all good, very simple"
Probed for deeper meaning
I do not feel comfortable sharing my honest opinion in fear of retribution and/or deterred career advancement.
Too much self-input (typing instead of answering).
I'm looking for the employee voice to be heard
open ended questions
free form is difficult.  multiple choice is easier.
I appreciate that they survey has changed to add comments as to why we feel it deserves to have a certain rating
"lack of clarity regarding how the results will roll up made it difficult to answer. As a people manager, I don't want my responses regarding my manager to be rolled into my team results and negatively reflect bad on myself"
The first page of the survey was unecessary. other than that it was fine.
ability to provide customized answers
"La simplicité du sondage me convient, toutefois, la clareté des questions est quelques fois questionnable, c'est à dire, parlons-nous de mon supérieur immédiat ou de la haute direction ?"
J'aime mieux les choix de réponses
Stick to multiple choice questions please
"The ability to provide more supporting information,"
All of the above     ;)
"Trying to remain anonymous, keeping answers high level."
It was short.
Very difficult to address everyone.  I'm happy with the selection of questions.
"Coverage: RBC, Leaders, Team, People Managers and Individual.  To the point and transparent vs. answers to multiple common questions which generated a feeling of mistrust in previous format."
This survey is reminding me of the challenges that inhibit my sense of purpose and ability to be effective and efficient performing my role.
I am glad I was able to express my feelings about certain situtations about working from home.
All of the above
"ability to write my own resonse rather than choose from your list, I'd like to see an innovative category for answers , rather than a box of disagree to agree I'd liek to see something akin to a numberline and I move a dial or item on that line to show where I fall, often I'm between categories ."
"clarity of the 1st question where we get to choose a topic, while having no idea why we are picking one and what our decision will lead to. It requires fixing!!!"
the questions are SO broad and very vague...it was 'difficult' to focus my responce.
Multiple choice preferred.
It shows RBCs commitment to their employees
Unconvinced my answers to this survey will have an impact or provide any insight.
Very general
It was stupid
This one asks for more direct commentary to help understand the answer provided.
It allowed me to provide additional details for some of the answers provided which provides clarity/background on those answers
I have the opportunity to express my ideas
not sure of the purpose of this survey. what will HR use this for - to actually implement changes or simply publish that RBC cares but not do anything about it?
Relevance of questions
"Une seule réponse possible, donc je réponds ici car 3 éléments à rapporter ci-dessus: Longeur du sondage, Clarté des questions et Simplicité du sondage. Peut-être prévoir une réponse multiple à cette question."
"questions were clear, it was definitely a shorter survey, and easy to answer but it is unclear how the answers will get aggregated, who will see what comments, and therefore I am a little concerned about potential consequences or how leaders will interpret the results"
I want to share genuine feedback and hopefully someone will read and implement what they preach
"It seems i get asked to fill in surveys all the time. It reminds me of completing surveys for customer service, the question is always: are you happy with your problem being solved. Often the answer is yes, but no one ever asks if i was happy having had to call the customer support in the first place..."
Pas de commentaires en particulier.
Certaines sujets clé n'ont pas été abordés (confiance dans la stratégie et new ways of working notamment)
"Its a survey - hard to be excited one way or the other - will reserve judgement pending whether or not its acted upon. On the plus side, good questions, good length, easy to use - from a logistics perspective, good"
It's more open ended question where the true needs of employee can be seen. The new generation are joining us and our management should be more creative in terms of managing these young forces and guide them in their career growth.
"en positif, des questions très ouvertes, en négatif, dire qu'on a sélection d'accord pour une réponse alors que j'avais sélectionné celle du milieu..."
i want to be heard
"the length of the survey is better; however, there are too many text fields."
Not sure if the purpose was to test the functionality of the survey app or to hear my thoughts on the points initially selected.
Apprehensive about being honest
The questions are very limited and are not asking employees questions that could address or enhance their concerns/experience with RBC
Tous les points précédents et possibilités de transmettre notre opinion
The survery to me has a mixed purpose as you pick a topic of interest to commetn on.  To me this directs the results somewhat.
confidential ?
"Contrairement aux sondages precedents, je ne vois pas comment celui ci va aider RBC a ameliorer ou modifier la satisfaction de ses employes. Ou meme de voir ce qui ne fondtionne pas vraiement au sein du groupe.pas asse de questions pour aller en profondeur."
I have no comments
It should be having questions from multiple areas of LIFE at RBC.
mandatory
Change is all that matters
"I'm glad these surveys exist, but the questions seem a little weak - I think the survey should have included better, more pointed questions."
I can write myself.
"Nothing wrong with the experience, but we receive an over abundance of surveys at RBC, many of which may be unnecessary. This will make some people less apt to complete them in general including more important ones."
I like the format. I am not sure I like the first question. It stumped me and I left it blank for that reason.
I feel that the survey only covered one area of concern.  I could be wrong after I submit my response but if it is this it would really be unfortunate.
Not sure of it's relevance
Ability to add comments supporting the ratings: i'd think this would be helpful to give commentary that adds 'shades' to the ratings
I sorta hope that my voice will be heard in the aggregated data from the gazzilion of responces
I liked the open text option. When you simply click a box you cannot expand on the reason why you answer that way.
It would have been helpful to know before starting that the answers would be mostly free form - this is different from previous surveys and requires more time and thought.
Sondage trop généralisé pas assez précis dans les questions.
"(Not a positive or negative experience, just a survey)"
from the lession i learned
The shortened survey length with the directed free text questions allows you to really share your thoughts about the organization.  I believe there is more value in the comments that can be derived from this format.  The old format left you tired by the end of the survey.  This one does not!
all of the above
Having to relate there are issues in the branch code of conduct ect
Being able to express my feelings and experiences freely
Opportunities to call out specific areas and elaborate in the comments.
"Not a lot of questions - seemed way too ""breezy"""
All of the above
"i would say all of the above , this is nice way to reply"
good - the survey helps to gather feedback from employees. bad - it takes time to write well thought out constructive feedback. There is no certainty that this feedback actually gets read and followed through with any satisfactory timeline.
"I felt the questions were relevant, but it was shorter than in years past.  I feel it missed important points e.g. ""I have the tools to do my job""."
very impersonal
i do not believe that this covers everything.
"""Clarity of questions"" for sure... but also there was nothing specific that was asked.  I was not clear re: what you were getting at with the questions nor did I feel like I could contribute any value to the questions asked as a result."
"not a lot of content nor questions for a EOS type ""survey"""
The survey was good but I feel there should be the ability to select more than one option with the question - Please select a topic from the list below to tell us more about your experience at RBC
too many open ended responses required
Ce sont toujours les mêmes questions qui nous sont posées dans les sondages!
The questions and the scope making it is valuable
Length of and ease of completing the survey
To voice my opinion based my experience within RBC.
Express deep feeling about RBC family
i want to share how great about RBC
The questions were far too vague. The EOS should dig deeper than the questions in this survey.
We fill in these surveys and sometimes things get better and some times not so much
Ability to speak openly and share views as opposed to selecting responses on a scale which may not tell the whole story.
"I felt that this survey was much too narrow sighted, and leaves the participant focusing on only a small area of the business. As a result it misses the opportunity to discuss other positive and negative experiences of working at RBC, along with areas where the company is doing well or needs further growth and development. I do not believe that choosing just one topic in the beginning, to focus on for the entirety of the rest of the survey is a good idea. There should be a component/question set for each topic (does not mean it has to be lengthy). Otherwise there will be a disproportionate amount of feedback for each topic, and there will be insufficient data for some categories to draw meaningful conclusions from as you cant guarantee an equal amount of people choosing those topics. Please do Better."
"C'est bien de pouvoir donner son opinion, mais je trouve l'exercice simpliste. Si l'entreprise veut savoir comment je me sens, qu'on me donne des questions plus claires sur des sujets précis."
Ability to write my feedback rather than a rating
"the ability to provide explanation to the answers provided which gives more colour on the feeling and sentiment, which should help management take the appropriate actions unlike the prior survey format."
Good mix of MC and paragraph answers and good length of survey overall
Being able to fill in comments.
Content is very considerate.
Why are we commenting this when answer is just strongly disagree ???
I don't think this survey allowed for employee concerns
Being able to use my own words to answer questions
chance to voice my opinion
"Très court ! J'aimerais ajouter un point que je voulais ajouter, mais le sondage est déjà terminé : Les valeurs et les qualités de mon supérieur sont tout aussi importants que le travail lui-même que je fais sur mon poste et j'ai un VP d'une très grande qualité."
More content around answers.
question simple et compréhensible. sondage court et possibilité de s'exprimer.
This survey is too broad. It only generates answers that the questions and topics ask.
I like that there are opportunities for generic answers but also devoted space for opinions about a particular question.
I felt that RBC really wants to listen to us now.
I felt much more heard by having the choice on what i wanted to voice as well as the feeling that my comments will be read
combination of both clarity and length of htis survey. should have been longer and geared more towards the emloyees own manager/team
ample opportunity to share comments and nuanced feedback.
Capacité de mettre des commentaires
WE ARE ASK TO COMPLETE SURVEY
Lack of complete anonymity.
Question vague
allows for elaboration to support our choices
The lenth was easier also the questions were straightforward.
Want to share my experince at this branch and voice my concerns.
"While the concerns on previous employee surveys were addressed and RBC did take steps to improve them, they did not last. I do not see this survey as having lasting impact just as the previous surveys did not."
the chance to share my opinion
freeform writing section - enough of having to stitch together two dozen poorly-worded stock phrases that no one understands and requires an annual clarification that the user has to bend and adapt to the questions and not vice versa.  sometimes (MOST times) a cigar is not a 73.5% indicator that the respondant is unhappy with their current paradigm
Possibilité d'expliquer plus en détail ma pensée en écrivant
"I had to resubmit a long response after a survey glitch. Aside from this, I had a good experience completing the survey."
allowed me to express my opinion in words not in multiple question answers
The targeted free text questions helped focus my response and I can see them being valuable information sources
"the survey itself is easy to complete, however the questions seemed so high level and general that I wonder how much useful information can actually be taken from it."
Appreciate the opportunity...but I don't have time to provide specifics in all the free form boxes.  Keep surveys to a simple statement selection in the future.
We get asked the same questions and nothing has improved over the last 5 years it just keeps getting worst
my opinion counts
"I wish there were more direct questions regarding staff (i.e. manager surveys), but the survey was short and sweet (and hopefully anonymous)"
lagginess
"J'aimais bien l'ancien sondage qui nous permettait de faire un survol sur de plus vaste sujet (Plein de questions qui touchent pleins de sujets), mais les questions à long développement nous donne l'impression d'avoir un impact sur le futur et nous donne l'impression que notre voix est écouté davantage. J'aime le côté personnalisé du sondage"
provide a channel to safety speak up during Pandemic; it shows organizationally our voice is valued.
Avoir eu la chance de m'exprimer en écrit
"This survey was easier, shorter and with a personal touch!"
Comments take more time - it's hard to know what to say.
A lot has been going on in the past six months and I certainly would be willing to share and spend more than 10 minutes to complete this survey. I would have preferred touching on many different subjects rather than just one ( knowing that I could have specified other- but it is nice to have the questions). It seems like the topics and questions are only skimming the surface.
"It allowed me to think, rather than select from a list of someone else's thoughts."
Speak up.
"The questions when prompted to provide details made me pause, reflect and provide meaninful feedback (hopefully)"
Gives an opportunity to speak on your thoughts regarding your time at RBC
The start of the survey was confusing.  The question could maybe have been a littel more clear to guide us as to what we should choose as many of the options could have applied.  i found it hard to choose just one.
I thought there would be more questions about management.
It's great that comments are solicited to give feedback.
problème avec la 2e question (on répond pas d'accord à tout à fait d'accord et par la suite on indique : à cette question vous avez répondu pas d'accord  ais ce n'est aps le cas - gros problème
Open ended questions allow me to voice an open and honest answer.
just to get heard about anything in this place
"The broad, overarching and generic nature of the questions don't particularly lend themselves to producing any substantive insights into the overall satisfaction of the typical employee."
Allowed me to think freely about my answers instead of being confined to canned answers
This feels more 'current' - I would have selected all of the above if I could have (with the exception of mobile device which I did not use)
Justement je ne trouvais pas que les questions étaient très claires.
provided mutiple areas/boxes for space to type feedback.
c est des sujets qu on aborde a chaque sondage
I do the survey to express my voice it is neither a good not bad experience it just is.
"I appreciated the ability to clarify and write in detail what my concerns are, and voice my opinions, as well as provide possible solutions for the issue."
I get to explain my reasoning; rather than just choose an already set choice
I like the fact that we can put personnal feedback frequently throughout the survey
The survey has changed significantly. Will we be able to get meaningful results from the responses? How is the change being managed to ensure employees don't abandon at the first question. Additional description to clarify the ask in the first question could also be helfpul.
It allows employee to freely speak up.  There are people who want their voice to be heard!
"My experience was good, that's all. Nothing more to add."
I think the surveys reflect someone emotional state at a point in time and if there has been influences within the day or week it could provide the users of the report with false results.   If decision are made on these results than I'm hoping the management takes a deeper dive of the results and truly understands them.
too generic vs previous EOS surveys
First page of my survey I think I made an errot which i realised only when i went into the next page but it gave me no options to edit
it's sad that I need to use this survey to be heard
"the survey was easy to complete and allows people tp be transparent.  What is truly done with the result, only time will tell!"
I don't feel like the right feedback was asked. Too many free text and very general questions.
All of the above
The freeform nature is both good and bad - not sure if this approach will yield meaningful answers especially if it is processed via automated analysis.
Reaon to complete this survey is unknown. Time has not been provided to complete this as other targets have been given in priority.
Possibilité de discuter de certains points.
I don't think comments can be aggregated in such a way as to accurately reflect the true sense of how the enterprise feels about any given subject.
Free form responses will bring forward the opinions that people really want to share and eliminate a forced response on some topics -so I liked the new format. Although this can be supported with couple other multi-choice questions in case some people do not feel fully comfortable with this format.
Both length and the ability to respond to questions in my own words
possibilité de mettre des commentaires.
to provide feedback to the team so we can improve what and how we service our clients and assist our employees.
"Sondage plus court, par contre la plupart des gens ne veulent pas prendre du temps pour écrire des commentaires."
Selecting a single topic at the beginning of the survey seems very limiting.
all of the above
Other than the choices above it asks why I chose my responses which to be me is the curx of my opinion..
"survery should be more specific, broken down into team, company, management, etc."
I will say all the above biggest being the length of survey
"J'ai pu m'exprimer un peu, merci."
Ability to provide additional feedback on non question-related subject matter
Maybe I should have read the directions more clearly....but are we really only anwsering questions on one topic?
The survey questions seem designed only to share positive answers. Not a great survey.
Short and to-the-point questions that force/encourage well thought answers
Subjective questions gives more option for us to express necessary and not normal redundant questions as before.
more multiple choice i cant help myself in written responses and tend to take longer to craft my resposnes.
all of the above
I am a new hire it was hard to answer.
The first question was a little strange and it wasn't very clear as to what was meant or what information was being asked.
It allows employees to express their feelings
"I prefer radial buttons, not free form text."
Allowing for added thoughts/perspectives to share.
"This survey is not clear, I have no idea what its asking for."
I don't like the free form text boxes.
allowed comments
"Liked the brevity/tone... and I liked the opportunity for more verbatim feedback, but that comes with two caveats: 1) with open-ended feedback, I'm less likely to ""feel heard"", and 2) as a manager, this survey gives me less feedback (quantitatively) assuming that the qualitative open-ended responses will be more meaningful... but, in my experience, they often get skipped over.  So, I like the general approach/philosophy, but I would actually like to see a few more multiple choice questions to give managers more concrete data to take insight from rather than relying potentially too much on the people who provide open-ended verbatim feedback... because the people who speak up are most often the ones who are either most loyal or most unhappy, when in reality it's the ""Neutrals"" (disengaged but caring) people who we really need to get to, listen to, and understand."
I struggle to see the value you will find from my responses
nature of questions and opportunity to provide feedback directly
"I think the open answers mean that it takes longer than anticipated to complete the survey, if you give somereal thought to your answers"
It's short enough to not be tedious and the screen is very easy to navigate but it's a survey so my feelings are neutral.
I am utterly confused as to why I had to select a section to complete. What about all the other sections? Are they not important. That's all I could think of as I completed the survey. It's certainly not where you want employee's minds to be where trying to answer questions thoughtfully!
Length and ease of completing the survey
Being to provide candid and confidential feedback. Its about the only way as we really cant share any of this with our managers even though we are encouraged to.
a place to voice out my concerns without fear.
the survey is very vague. i enjoyed the first version better because it divided every category seperately
Glad to express views that may not have appeared on other surveys completed and that honest feedback whilst being respectful is a good thing.
Ability to share my experience and express oneself.
comment section
I think it is a good idea to start with the opening general question with expected comments before jumping into the detailed ones rather than keeping open questions for the end
Je vois pas en quoi c'est une expérience positive que de répondre à ce sondage. Drôle de question ...
Responding to free text questions requires more time and thinking than in previous multiple choice surveys
the ability to add free form comments to supplement the rating scale
It was ok
I don't consider surveys to be an experience to be rated as positive or negative.
question ouvertes et large nous permettant de bien nous exprimer.
Not much content. Survey seems very surface level and superficial
opportunity to voice out
toutes ces questions
"Being able to have a voice, as to how I/we have been feeling.  Hopefully to make a difference."
emphasis on employees adding specific comments is a welcome change to the survey model
all the above
I sense that RBC is interested to capture individual notes and not just tick boxes.
would like to share of my feeling
"Was surprised at the amount of free form responses, made it slightly more difficult to respond, but also hopefully will give you more insights"
One page failed and lost my responses.   To much free form text.
It is really hard to find the time
"For sure, this will be shown to the management."
Survey is ok.
Rather the survey be more on objective questions
I am pleased to have a voice in my future and the experience of working for RBC.
We were asked to complete this survey
Clarté des questions ?  Non pas vraiment.  On veut qu'on ouvre notre coeur n'est-ce pas?
la simplicité du sondage et la possibilité de répondre (rédiger sans limite de caractéres). C'est un sondage que je qualifierai de questions ouvertes qui laisse la possibilité de s'exprimer. J'aurais souhaité avoir plus de question où il y'avait la possibilité de rédiger sa réponse (de manière facultative pour satisafire à tous :) )
Clear questions and no words limit for the explanation
Opportunity to express input through verbal methods as opposed to rating scales.  My onne recommendation would be to allow staff to expand on their answers on specific topics of their choice.
the survey is a little open-ended... doesn't do a great job in framing the conversation. Also having only one option at the end to provide additional feedback can imply our 'open' feedback is not as much of a priority.
"j'avais l'opportunité de davantages m'Exprimer , de donner mes opinions."
"I thought the first question was the hardest...if I chose a topic, then didn't have much to say on the topic- it was tricky.  Also, I think sometimes it is hard for responders to answer ""essay"" type questions.  But I think the content of the survey was VERY good."
"Not really sure what survey questions are trying to get at.  Entirely vague.  Was intent for open speak up about Employee Survey?  If so, then answer is that anyone with experience knows it's a game.  Unless answered all top box, know that a lot of work/meetings/focus groups coming to address what is wrong.  If things are ok, then best just to answer the top box.  I believe intent at high levels of Bank is well placed, does that as moves down the chain of command."
Opportunity to provide candid feedback that may not be directly tagged to a question and can be more free flow.
"Completed many surveys over the years, not many changes or results"
I think i just need to get used to the free text answers a bit more...they are time consuming and can be subject to interpretation
Ability to add comments
"simple, fast, lots of opportunity to build on answers for clarity"
Toutes ces réponses ou presque.
there was more opportunity to articulate our responses here
J'ai moins aimer les questions a développements
The questions were very limited.  Questions around workplace diversity are missing.  I don't beleive the survey will bring much value to understand who the RBC employees are and what they would like to see from RBC as an employer.
La possibilité de m'exprimer dans l'anonymat
"Found there were too many vague questions that we could fill out, easier multiple choice"
RBC needs to do better in playing lower employees better wages
All of the above!
It would be beneficial if we were able to choose more topics and not just one.
Prompts you to articulate the reasoning behind certain key answers.
Felt like the questions were more relevant to me than usual
possibilité de développer
clarity of questions but also the questions are appropriate for us to elaborate our thoughts and feels during this pandemic
"I found the first question a little awkward and wasn't sure what I was really selecting, but otherwise, this was good."
"Clarity of question, length of survry and  ease of completing"
"The first question was a bit weird, not sure where it was leading with my choice. I ended up going with the first option."
too many open questions
some questions should not be
scenario and situation
Having the ability to offer specific heartfelt comments
"Ease of completing the survey is a positive, but I also liked the opportunity to free text to better articulate my perspective"
The survey is standard. The experience will be based on the action taken from feedback provided and as i dont know what that will look like i can not disagree nor agree.
Not sure if feedback will be read/used
"A cette occasion, je me suis senti très à laise, le message est accueillant."
You gave me a chance to express myself.
an anonymous avenue for expression
its designed for positive answers extracts
Pretty open-ended questions
Opportunity to choose a category of interest
All of the above along with the questions address the right issues and have variety enough to cross the spectrum of experiences.
All of the Above!!!
it was fine
forced to do it
Would have preferred a whole overall survey rather than on just one subject as I wasn't sure which one to pick at the start until I was asked the questions.
Open ended questions were included which allowed feedback to be provided in a more meaningful way.
My concern can be brought up and answered.
"all of the above but I noticed we had more space to communicate, in our own words, how we feel instead of responding to a multiple choice question."
"Like being able to add our own thoughts, the choice of what to comment on at the beginning is a bit vague."
not sure about privacy having to answer open ended questions which may reveal my identity
I prefer not to do surveys
"prefer ratings, not free text"
Felt like poking at an open wound.
To communicate what I honestly feel about.
not a huge fan of surveys
Ability to write out specifics on answers versus all questions being responses on an agree / disagree scale
ability to provide written responses
"Liked everything about it (brief, nature of the questions, simple scale). The only drawback was technical....I was left hanging for a time on the network...not sure if it was me  or the server."
the opportunity to express opinions and comments
"Très bien, très bonne longueur, 1ere question un peu moins claire"
I liked the questions and format. I don't believe I've ever been asked these questions in this type of survey.
Providing open ended comment boxes will not elicit much clarity from respondents. Also questions should be clearer and more specific in my opinion for ease of understanding
"It seems rather simplistic compared with the previous survey.  While the previous survey was probably too long, this one feels too short.  Will you be able to compare with previous results?"
"Unsure what was meant by ""good experience"". The survey was well constructed and easy to respond to."
"I am doing this between clients, which is extremely inconvenient"
This survey provides the opportunity for emploees to express themselves and to share theri thoughts of the company.
different of types of questions and different ways to respond.
the belief it will not result in anything
"I did it on my lunch hour , in the cash cage in peace."
Possibilité de m'exprimer à mon aise.
Capable to add my thoughts to clear questions
Hard to trust what will come of being honest.
"Clarity of questions + as Inter/Hourly, I work in various branches and experiences many realities. These surveys seem to be written in a way to generalize the RBC experience to its own benefit"
Ability to express content in free format as well
notre opinion change rien
Hoping it was a worthwhile use of time and looking forward to result!
I get to express what i really feel working in this bank.
Not sure survey is making a difference?
all of the above plus insightful questions
Having the opportunity to give free format feedback as the survey is short.
That first question was a bit discouraging...I was worried that the whole survey was going to be that nebulous.  I almost closed the survey after I read the first question.  It might be better further along in the survey and/or adjusted somehow.  Rest was reasonable.
I feel the objective or end result for this survey is not very clear.
the way the results are used
Why do we do surveys when nothing comes from it?
"Ability to explain thoughts, feelings and mindsets beyond questions"
Having to write out feelings of each question. Makes for a variable of openness from employees that multiple choice questions would avoid.
Chance to include comments
"The coverage of survey dose not seem very comprehensive, but maybe it's the way it was intended?"
"I don't think the survey gives the kind of clarity of employee engagement and 'happiness'. It is too short to get a good picture on how employees feel, either about their management or about RBC in general. So it is ""fine"", but if RBC management wants to understand what systemic problems are within its divisions, areas, and departments, this isn't it."
It took off some pressure off of feelings that have been building up since a while. Thank you
Agree/Disagree is a vague way to analyze and does not provide specific information you might be looking for. Postive or negative.
"It is a combination of all listed above. Also, the fact that I'm motivated to give credit where credit is due."
"The questions posed are too nebulous and non-specific.  It does not get to where I can make a justment on a specific detail, but seems to want it left vague so you can use the survey to justify your agenda.  The questions asked seem to be worded to avoid getting any specific answer (just the like the annual survey)."
Please be respect protect our privacy is the most important. Thanks
made me look at how I was feeling
Having the opportunity to provide feedback.
Conciseness and focus of the survey.
Possibilité de développer sur certains points du questionnaire et la longueur du sondage est de beaucoup améliorer.
Survey is still uni-dimensional
Possibilité de s'exprimer en laissant des commentaires.
Proving honest feedback
It's important for any company and any employee to be able to communicate about important issues.
too general..
ces questions ouvertes nous donnent la possibilite de relater ce que l'ont pense.
feedback is important .
The development questions are great because we can really express ourselves and not just click general answers.
I was able to focus on what I wanted - work from home and the ERGs
"The length is great, easy question and the opportunity to expand and give your reasoning for your response."
Don't know that anyone will actually pay attention to this.
"I liked the fact that some questions needed to be explored more that just an ""I agree"" and RBC was curious to know why. I feel these expanded responses more accurate"
providing additional comments is great.
"Sondage avec espace pour commentaire et choix de réponse, clair, facille, pas trop long. Permet de nous exprimer et partager."
asking real questions that affect me
Feels like you're passing the responsibility of identifying concerns and their solutions on to the employees.  Free text is easier to identify who answered which quesitons and removes the annonymity.
The survey generated an error after  I spend a 3-5 minutes typing other feedback resulting in me having to start over and loosing interesting in retyping all that i had intent to share.
All of the above
too much of me writing to answer promts - which I don't like
"I am very hesitant providing text responses as it compromises confidentiality despite the assurances provided.  More direct and thorough responses can be achieved through the open-ended responses; however, the confidentiality needs to be better addressed."
"Clarity, easy and not too long of a survey together with adding comments is a good idea!!"
Free format answers allowed me to clarify my thoughts on some of the questions.
In stead of simple YES/No or Agree/Disagree it gave a opportunity to explain.
To provide honest feedback.
"Not as detailed as I expected, which helps gauge our thoughts and opinions."
the question about picking a topic. i had nothing to choose or say really.
"rapide, efficace et simple"
plus d'endroits pour exprimer notre opinion
Communicate my opinion and thoughts to RBC
"longueur, simplicité, la réflexion que ca nous pousse a avoir et clarté des questions !"
Ability to enter text responses rather than 100% multiple choice.
There were a number of interesting topics to choose from at the beginning but it was not made clear that you would only have the opportunity to provide input on one of this topics as part of the survey.
to privide input
There was some ability to explain personal interpretation of the questions.
Be able to add own comment instead of only multiple choices.
I like the opportunity to add comments / written responses to your follow up questions
not much is done about the issues that are brought up
Being able to share how our feelings in our own words.
Thoughprovoking questions that require a detailed answer
I was expecting questions about my manager and leaders.
Open ended questions
"Answer is ""clarity of questions"", but I would also like to better understand the confidentiality of this and whether or not direct management would be privy to unfiltered responses."
Open ended questions. Not only to what you think you should be measuring but geared towards what others may actually have to say.
If English is not your first lengauge it may be challenging to put your words correctly on paper.
I do not like this new format with the open ended questions as the responses are shared exactly as they are written and this means that you can be identified based on your writing style.  This also means that responses will be carefully measured and not complete.
"Quite a few surveys, little observable change."
Ability to give a bit more details than the multiple choice question.
I like the ability to provide real examples.  Free form text provides context to some answers.
being able to answer honestly.
"I submitted several comments under - anything else to share, and received an error message, and reloaded and the comments disappeared. Not sure if they are included. otherwise GREAT survey, and enjoyed the flexibility to respond to what matters most to me /and free texts"
The survey asks mostly irrelevant questions to the challenges of 2020 and does not ask my opinion on relevant topics.
Odd format
Written section available to voice specific concerns.
"It felt simple, albeit some aspects (ex: required verbatim) are something to get use to."
Not enough feedback requested; too short
I wanted to share my opinion
Clarity + Ease +  lenght of the survey
La possibilité de développer en quelques lignes mes réponses et de pouvoir parler de certains sujets importants à mes yeux concernant les salariés et l'avenir de RBC Paris
"The free text is nice to be able to share thoughts, but it does make completing the survey a little more involved."
Management needs to know who people are feeling
"Length of sucery, Ease of completing the survery, clarity of the questions and spots to share our openion."
la facon que la premiere question est pose a necessite de relire plusieurs fois pour comprendre
"I guess it is great for some people that comments can be written in the free text boxes but, I hope that the personal choice of either doing it or not doesnt change anything in the overall survey results for the reporting officer."
able to see improvements
Possibilité d'exprimer son opinion à l'aide de réponse qualitatives détaillées.
it's a survey.  don't really think in terms of experience.
"There were not enough ""agree to disagree"" line items that gave us the opportunity, especially as a more junior member of the team, to share our opinion on our leaders, team leads, etc. While I acknowledge leaving open ended questions provides us with the opportunity to share those feelings, it is sometimes difficult to openly discuss feelings towards more senior members of the group. Open ended questions are best used for other concepts such as WFH, processes, etc."
All of the above
"The ability to actually write your own answers instead of picking a multiple choice answer that fits the best, but doesn't really apply.  This is our true voice; our chance to speak our own words, and I appreciate the opportunity."
This survey does not serve the best interest of myself or my fellow employees.
"Surevy kept crashing, it took me  4 to 5 attempts to completed, not a very lean process"
Being able to highlight the gaps in our sysytem
Random questions do not make for a consistent narrative; make the overall point and survey results unclear.
specipic opnion to share
"I found it a bit confusing, having to make a selection at the beginning. And so much free text made it feel a bit cumbersome."
I appreciate being able to articulate my thoughts in my own words rather than selecting the closest pre-determined option.
i am able to express myself
"Nous trouvons qu'il n'est pas assez détaillé et que certain question ne sont pas très claire. Par contre, nous apprécions pouvoir nous exprimer en écrivant nos réponses"
Standard suvery
"RBC consider employess's feelings, rbc will do better after knowing our voice"
"Le sondage, permet de donner une opinion sincère et de l'expliquer au besoin."
"The questions were too vague, therefore the answers may not reflect the message that has to be relayed"
J'aime bien quand on touche plusieurs sujets. Pas assez de sujet pour un sondage employés annuels selon moi.
Émettre des commentaires et suggestions
The text areas encouraged a written response which made it more personal.
The reality is that life is not just a bunch of yes or no and multiple choices. It was good to be able to elaborate my thoughts and to write meaningful suggestions.
how effective this survey?
je n'aime pas répondre à des sondages
"The Option to give more comments throughout the entire Survey, not only the end."
Seems similar to all other employee surveys.
"Avec l'erreur sur la question de précision qui ne m'avait pas été posé, c'est pas encore à point, mais pour le reste c'est beaucoup mieux."
I like being asked my opinion.  It makes me feel valued by RBC when asked for honest feedback.
I am not sure if it makes a difference or not
possibilité de répondre au sondage sur des sujets qui comptent vraiment pour moi
I felt the questions did not dig deep into understanding the employee experience and may not provide deep insights.
It took more thinking to provide details on the reasons for the answers.
I do not have an opinion on that.
"The questions asked are relevant. Survey allowed for free-form comments, whereas many poorer surveys do not."
"Clear, simple, not lenghty and straight to the point."
"The amount of open-ended questions, allowing me to feel as though you're seeking to listen."
I wanted to complete the survery regardless the length and provide my opinion. The survey was well done.
I do not feel comfortable sharing experiences and do not belive the survey is anonymous.
The fact that I was reflecting on my negative experience and that I don't think anything positive will be done with my feedback.
Very open ended and leaves a lot to interpretation which I view as both a pro and con.
explaining the rationale requires careful thought and reflection but is a better approach to obtain more detailed feedback I suspect
only through constructive feedback will things change - there was no ill intent in my answers :)
I liked that there were more questions this year that required a written answer and expanding on why we selected a certain response
toutes ces reponses sont bonnes
Ability to express thoughts rather than tick a box
I was able to say what I wanted to say not just pick set answers in a multiple choice.
Specific question to share additional information
i wanted to give my opinion
I'd have liked the opportunity to expand on some other specific questions. It'd be nice to have that opportunity for any question we choose.
Simplicity with some space for personal imput. I feel heard.
I just do not believe that anything will be done.
"Some questions are too general to include precise answer, especially about the managers."
"Il n'y a plus de distinction entre RBC, notre directeur direct et la direction en général."
It is a survey?
"The survey was shorter and quicker. But I did not particularly like how the open-ended questions were worded, and how in a way the randomized choice of these questions does not encourage responding on other topics that may be important to you."
"Thought-provoking questions, rather than the tradition multiple-choice!"
I would prefer less open text questions
"Intent of this survey, are the question specific enough to really gage how we feel."
I don't like the flow from the very beginning of the survey
The ability to comment on more than the specified questions
I prefer multiple choice as opposed to writting lengthy comments.  The questions around writing comments can be a bit vague.
"All of the above, simple and straight forward."
"It was precise, specific and short, and much needed"
I like how this survey incorporated text boxes so we can freely write in depth responses.
Do not like the open-ended questions.
lenght of survey and questions not covered which would have been appropriate seeing the current circumstances. We have longer surveys annual about our manangement; now that we are in complete different environment a longer survey might have been more educationnal.
The survey allows for persons to be more open with giving feedback
COVID has many unknowns.
The free form questions were too vague to be sensible. I was keen to participate but feel like I wasted mu time.
I like the open ended questions to provoke thought
not sure the questions really get at the heart of the matter and not sure how this will roll up to give opinons to management
"I don't understand the purpose of this survey. I've only been asked to elaborate on questions I related positively, instead of ones where you had an opportunity to gather feedback on opportunities to improve."
A good opportunity for self reflection
I feel this survey didn't cover as much as previous version
The opportunity to express an opinion with the assurance of confidentiality and that my comments would not be held against me.
The clarity of questions asked & the ease with which I was able to complete it.0
Free form opportunity
je ne vois pas l'intérêt
I like the fact that the survey does not have any identifying information at the beginning so you can tell which area of the bank the person completing the survey works.  This allows you to be more forthcoming with your answers to the survey.
"I think the clarity of questions feeds into it, but I am also a ""big data"" type of person and have a hard time thinking that you will be getting much out of the free form survey. Lots of advanced analytic capabilities out there so I may be wrong. Have a hard time seeing how the results will cascade down to individual team levels (per the legacy survey) given the free reign we have."
Previously you put a character limit on commented responses - which was irritating and infuriating. That limit has appeared to be lifted allowing me to say what I needed to say.
It is not too long. The questions are all different and not the same questions using different wording like before. More comment section between questions is a better flow vs before it was at the end.
"Starting with a comment box and picking a topic to start a survey is odd.  Its actually a very intimidating way to start a survey.  Change the format so the radio button questions are first.  Those questions are simple, easy to understand and easy to rate. Actual length and ease is fine.  But too many comments boxes and I feel like Im repeating myself.  And will it be understood they way it was intended or will it lead to more questions from the reader.  Im not sure."
Possibilité d'inscrire plus que le sondage nous suggère
"though I understand the need for this kind of thing, it takes away useful work time to answer awkward questions"
"Un sondage, c'est un sondage..."
"Questions were clear, yet might result in some bias."
Surveys seem never to lead to  real change.
I am not sure if it will be favourable one for me or will be one that ends my career.
Finally a forum to be honest.  Honesty is a rare comodity at RBC.
"one wonder if we speak the truth m, what will happen to us?"
to be connected with whats up and now with RBC>
being able to express my thoughts in detail with sentences and not words.
Nice graphics plus it brings out the sentiments of what an EOS should be.
"Abilit to select the topic I am passionate about, or feel compelled to elaborte on; less generic and more personal."
I do not care for free form answers in surveys.
I did not find the survey meaningful in that it only slightly touched on personal engagement.
"When given a free-text space, the survey questions should be more specific, not less."
I do not understand this question
I really like the ability to answer quick questions as well as free form write.  I think the free form questions this year are better and will get better overall feedback.
all of the above
ability to share detailed feedback which is hopefully more helpful than trying to rely on a small dsta set to make some very large decisions.
I like the opportunity to give answers with examples rather than just rate
Possibilité de pouvoir s'exprimer
The opportunity to select and expand on a topic was good to focus a written response
"I wanted to choose more than one option. Clarity of questions, Easy to complete and Length."
I feel that I am able to express myself more
"My answers were based on my current role. I was not clear if this survey was for me to speak to my experience as a whole or just current. If that was clarified and past expereiences were included, it may have been just slightly less positive in a couple of categories."
I normally don't answer free-form questions due to time but happened to take this at a time when I had a few minutes. I think it might be too long if I didn't carefully consider when I was completing it.
"I don't like the number of free-form boxes to complete. I prefer the old survey where it was all ticking the box of agree, disagree etc."
I would prefer multiple choice
Toutes ces réponses!!!!!
est ce que cela sert a quelque chose?
this survey did not seem comprehensive or touch on many of the facets of employees day to day activities in which they should share their opinions/ideas/etc.
"It is good, but prefer the multiple choice over typed responses"
This survey wasn't as comprehensive as the previous EOS surveys.
These surveys are just a way to vent and do not serve any purpose.. Staff will not speak out to managers for fear of reprisal or usual being ignored.
the experience was easy but neither good or bad
Je n'ai pas aimé avoir à chosir un seul sujet et de devoir écrire autant de commentaires.
I really want the top management take some action.
"The questions were clear, but i also had the opportunity to expand on my responses."
"Didn't ask the right questions. Given everything employees are going through right now, there was no recognition of COVID and the impact its having on employees."
Catharsis
simplicité du sondage
no comment
I do not like providing feedback to anyone about working here. It is only seen as whining.
Seems a little short and trivial
"I don't believe they work, just as this will not work. Because of the retribution people believe will happen if they really voiced their opinions."
Focus area for answers is much more helpful than rating several categories
Surveys are always made in such a way to get a specific response
I fear for the confidentiality.
Multiple Choice is easier then Short Answer.
It's nice I could elaborate on some topics - and not yes or no type of questions
on nous pose toujours les memes questions
Being able to express yourself
"Although the survey was: easy, short, clear, I do not believe it captures an accurate representation of information based on the questions. Prior EOS surveys may have been longer and more tedious but definetly made me feel my voice was heard."
Very narrow in focus.
It allowed for more personal input. I think there is a lot of value in that.
The ability to express some of deepest feelings
The free text questions gave me pause for thought.
The scroll arrows up and down were too small. Why scroll when most of the questions could have been formated to fit one page.
Format for the last question was unexpected and made me spend significantly more time than advertised to complete the survey.
What is the true purpose of the survey?  What is the end result?
"Could include some better questions that probe a bit deeper. You have left it to employees to type answers that do that, however a lot may not feel comfortable doing that."
aucune valeur ajoutée car on ne nous écoute pas de toute façon.
"Not overly keen on including comments, as it can be subjective. Plus it takes more time to complete. While the suvey was short, it was not my favourite."
I feel I could better express my point in a face to face enviroment
coudnt complete the survey due to having issues completing the survey as there was ICAP issues
Flexibility to focus on what matters most to me.
"easy, guided click thru, but get rid of the images that take up half the window!"
survey is survey
the comment questions actually forced me to think about what I wanted to share that was most important to me - usually open text annoys me - the way the questions were asked forced me to reflect - I am curious about what questions others got
These questions were only focused on the positive. A survey needs to understand what is the good and the bad. Needed more questions and dive deeper.
"as we always have to put strongly either way, it doesnt really reflect the real nature of our feelings. Europe doesnt really go by strongly automatically"
"It was brief, but it did not go into certain aspects of the job, such as feeling in control.  Much too broad a survey covering only high level RBC."
"too narrow in focus. also should preface the survey that only a few questions on one topic. how will this provide enough data to understand trends if everyone selects a different area? with 100 FTE's; might only have ~10 responses per ""area"" selected to respond to"
a lot a annoying tasks I do not want to start immediately
"the questions doesnt comprise other factors like renumeration, assessments etc"
I believe RBC cares how employees feel about the company and want feedback on how things are going and could get better.
It is not so easy to complete the survey because English is not my mothertongue
"It's an ok survey but the questions are a bit random, just asking about 2 or 3 very specific topics. You should ask how people are coping? Physically? Mentally? Do they need support? Would they like extra support? Are the communications enough? etc etc"
Coverage seems limited.
"it is important for everyone to share thought, this grant the chance to grow as an individual, as a team and as RBC of course"
"The survey format is different, it asks for more open answers, which I like, but since some of the questions are randomize, how do we ensure everyone get to speak about the range topics of fairly? I do not know if this is the final format of the survey, but I don't mind answering to all the questions open-ended instead of random questions selected."
"1. Its all of the above and also the ability to provide our comments which helps us to relay the message more effectively. Also the comments box does not have word limit, hence we are able to provide as much inputs with examples as possible"
"possiblity to indicate my comments, as sometime the closed questions could be not very clear"
Reluctance to share view.
Ability to eloborate on one's answers. The regular staff survey is too rigid and feels like it is designed to deliver a pre-determined outcome. The staff survey needs to be more flexible to allow employees to identify issues not highlighted by the rigid questions structure.
"Possibilité de réponses ouvertes, et laissant la place pour développer un point de vue, un argumentaire."
"Surveys rarely change anything at ground level.  Even radical changes at the top are largely filtered out by the time you reach the bottom.  If you want big change, make those changes from the bottom up and from the middle down"
It's not detailed enough for RBC to really undderstand what the issues are
"Il est très difficile voir naïf de penser qu'une participation à un sondage va changer la vie du personnel. C'est un sondage de plus, sans suivi d'effet notables."
"Peu importe le type de sondage qui soit réalisé. RBC mettra en avant : on vous a entendu, on agit. C'est faux pour l'Europe. Tous lsproblèmes qui sont remontés ont tous vu une réponse et des actions concrètes mises en place mais dans les faits rien ne change. On continue à agir comme avant. Dans 10 ans RBC ITS n'existera plus. On ne sera pas viable avec une gestion telle qu'elle est opérée par Londres pour l'ensemble de l'Europe"
"I do prefer the new tailored approach to the survey, which surely will provide more meaningful data. That said, given our stated client centricity, I would have expected a client servicing/relationship related option in the list of topics to choose from to share our experience."
I firmly believe in democracy. we all have a voice its no good saying later you dont agree or like it if you made no attempt to change it or influence the outcomes
New perspective. More stimulating as more thinking and better / more meaningful feedback
open ended questions are not as easy to answer
"Some of the questions seem to be aimed at a ""back slapping"" exercise rather than looking for genuine input to improve."
It is very timely for me as I felt so overwhelmed with work last night
"allowing text and message to be conveyed in ""words"""
Gave me the opportunity to use a different mode to voice my concerns
"Free format, allow user to provide feedback/comments based on what they think they are satisfied with and what not"
I likes the fact that i can complete the question with what I meant
"I had no issues completing the survey, and found it to be a reasonable length, and the questions sufficient to give me a sense that my feedback would be understood."
It shows that RBC is taking action to let we know that they care.
Too many free format questions
Made me reflect and appreciate
It was not made clear if this was anonymous in the invitation.
I was not comfortable providing honest and critical feedback. As I believe my answers are not anonymous.
"It could be just my famiarity with teh previous version, but the open form questions often pose a challenge in responding and are time consuming. Also starting off teh survey with teh open ended question kind of throws off the respodent."
Wasn't sure what category to pick - maybe it's suppose to be like that
I think there were too many qualitative questions that require more thought and time
"I found there was too much variety in question type for having so few questions. Also, opening wtih a broad 'choose one topic to comment on' was awkward and I wasn't ready for an open text response as the first question.  Would prefer a little more consistency and structure.  Also, what if I wanted to share thoughts on 2 or 3 of the topics. I didn't get that opportunity.  I didn't feel like the survey allowed me to full share my 'engagement'. seemed more like a mini pulse.  if that was the intent, then the instructions could have been more clear so I wouldn't feel like i missed the opportunity to be heard or asked."
a lot more written feedback is to be provided. Questions on difect management and senior management should be included
Too basic.
I appreciate the banks concern for its staff.
nothing novel or innovative about this - its just another survey
Survey seems too short / too general
It felt too random.  The dialogue boxes felt forced and didn't necessarily capture info I may have otherwise shared had I been given more optionality
typical survery.. Don't see anything different to the one I answer yearly
To many open ended questions. The first question before multiple choice should not be open ended.
this survey was willing to ask about seniro leadership which were questions that were dropped from the EOS survey in the past 4 years.
didn't like the follow up questions.
Thought the questions were limited and not really focused on resolving anyting of importance
survey gives employees a voice.
How about the questions
"I appreciate the effort to find out what employees are thinking and feeling. I commend you for it. If you can create an environment where people can honestly say what they feel and it were to impact the workplace in a meaningful way, you wouldn't need to do so many surveys."
it wasn't very clear what the purpose of the first selection was for
